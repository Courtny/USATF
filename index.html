          <h2>Welcome to the USATF Level 2 Throwing Skills Progression</h2>
          <h3 class="fw-bold">About this project</h3>
          <p class="fs-body2">The competitive performance of a thrower in track and field is an aggressive display of strength, power, and technique. The throws are complicated movements performed at high speed in limited spaces. From a training perspective, the hammer, weight throw, shot put, discus, and javelin are classified as the speed and power events. Although each event is unique, they share many qualities needed for success. Although physical condition and athleticism are both imperative, an athleteâ€™s technical ability contributes significantly to overall performance. At the elite level of the sport, many believe that technique is the largest discriminating factor among athletes. Coaches of throwing athletes must help their athletes build and maintain strength while also developing refined techniques.</p>

            <h4>What you'll learn</h4>
            <li>Beginner movement patterns</li>
            <li>Intermediate movement patterns</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h1>Shot Put</h1>
        <p>
           Shot-putters must develop a set of skills that at first may seem unnatural. They must learn posture and balance and feel comfortable pivoting on the ball of the foot. The arm strike in shot-putting is also unique to the event; no other sport requires a push from the front deltoid with the elbow at a 90-degree angle to the body.
