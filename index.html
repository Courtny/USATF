          <h3 class="fw-bold">About this project</h3>
          <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg">The competitive performance of a thrower in track and field is an aggressive display of strength, power, and technique. The throws are complicated movements performed at high speed in limited spaces. From a training perspective, the hammer, weight throw, shot put, discus, and javelin are classified as the speed and power events. Although each event is unique, they share many qualities needed for success. Although physical condition and athleticism are both imperative, an athleteâ€™s technical ability contributes significantly to overall performance. At the elite level of the sport, many believe that technique is the largest discriminating factor among athletes. Coaches of throwing athletes must help their athletes build and maintain strength while also developing refined techniques.</p>

        <div id="Shotput">
          <h1>Shot Put</h1>
          <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg">
             Shot-putters must develop a set of skills that at first may seem unnatural. They must learn posture and balance and feel comfortable pivoting on the ball of the foot. The arm strike in shot-putting is also unique to the event; no other sport requires a push from the front deltoid with the elbow at a 90-degree angle to the body.

            The discus throw requires athletes to exert high forces against the ground through a series of rhythmic movements. Because of the aerodynamic nature of the event, knowledge of the types of implements available is important. The discus is lighter in weight and travels faster and farther than the shot, but it is more difficult to control. Fully mastering the mechanics of the release is more difficult in the discus event than it is in the shot put event.

          <h1>Hammer Throw</h1>
          <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg">
            The technical demands of the hammer throw make it very challenging for both the athlete and the coach, possibly second only to the pole vault. As with the other three throwing disciplines, the aim of the hammer throw is to project the implement as far as possible without committing a foul. Athletes commence a throw by performing preliminary winds, or swings, in which they swing the hammer overhead in a circular arc while facing the rear of the circle. They accelerate the hammer to the point of release by performing turns across the throwing circle.

            Unlike other throwing events, the javelin allows the competitor to build speed over a considerable distance. In addition to core and upper-body strength, javelin throwers benefit from the agility and athleticism typically associated with running and jumping events. Successful javelin throwers often share more physical characteristics with sprinters and jumpers than with athletes in the other throwing events. However, javelin throwers still require the power associated with larger and heavier athletes. Because javelin throwing can be stressful on the shoulder and arm, proper technique is particularly important.
